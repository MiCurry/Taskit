## UI/UX

### Admin User: 'I need help assigning simple tasks to my volunteers, but they arrive at times when I am busy, or can't talk.'

### Voulnteer User: 'I don't want to create an account so I can clean a toilet.'

* Interviewed Admin users to discover their goal in Event Volunteer Coordination. 
* Compeleted a task flow analysis of the Event Coordinator and Volunteer. (2 users)* 
* Proposed "How Might We" Questions to discover new ways of solving the coordintaion problem.
* Developed Personas for our 2 users (Admin and Volunteer)
* Determined Mental Models for our 2 users
* Documented a Design System for our brand.
* Mocked up prototypes for user tasks and haded off to front end developers.
* Put mockups in front of a Admin User to see what tasks she expected specific functionality to acccomplish.
* Put mockups in front of Admin User to see if the propsed product would event solve a problem.
* Made adjustments to design based of user feedback.
* Kept team on track with the users in mind.

If I had time I would...
* Interview more Event Coordinators to determine what their true needs are.
* Tested prototypes with users to see that the mental models I developed align with their's.
* A/B Test products.
* Determine how the application would present tasks to volunteers.
* Further explore the sms interaction. How could a volunteer get a new task when they finished without having to go back to the ipad?
